The data was first cleansed to a detailed level.  And although there is a significant amount of detail for both Items and Outlets, I did not find enough correlation in the detailed subsets to assist in identifying trends. I decided to take a 'big picture' approach by analyzing the following:

1. What is the performance of each Outlet type by mean total sales.

2. What is the performance of each Item type by mean total sales. 

3. What is the performance of each Item type at each Outlet type.

   



When measuring mean sales performance, Supermarket Type 3 was by far the highest performer.![OutletSalesbyOutletType](/images/OutletSalesbyOutletType.png)





When measuring mean Item sales performance, Starchy Foods was the highest sales performer, followed closely by Seafood.

When comparing the sales performance of each Item type at each of the four Outlet types, there are some observations:

1. Supermarket Type 3 significantly underperformed in a high sales item; Seafood. How could that be improved to boost sales? 
2. Supermarket Type 3 significantly outperformed in a lower sales performance item; Breakfast items. What factors here could be applied to higher sale items?  
3. The Grocery Store sales trend averaged down in the higher performing sales items. How can that be improved to boost sales?
4. What factor led to the boost in Seafood sales for Supermarket Type 1 and Supermarket Type 2? How could those factors be used to boost sales in other Items?

The recommendation is to examine factors that led to the noted observations in sales trends, and apply those factors towards the higher sales items. There should be an effort to have each Item sales trend average up for higher sales items. Emphasis on higher sales items will lead to a boost in overall Item sales for each Outlet Type.
